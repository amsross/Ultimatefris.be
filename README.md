# [Ultimatefris.be](http://ultimatefris.be)

Ultimatefris.be is intended to be a simple platform for announcing and joining games, with as little overhead and time spent as possible. It is development, created and maintained by [Matt Ross](http://rhinorojo.com/).

To get started, checkout [http://ultimatefris.be](http://ultimatefris.be)!



## Add a game

You can add a new games [here](http://ultimatefris.be/games/new).

All games should have a short but descriptive title, a location and a date/time.
The location will automatically normalize and update the map so you and your other players know exactly where to go.

The game is tied to your IP address upon creation, so viewing the game from the same location will give you the option of Removing the game and, in the future, editing it.



## Find a Game

You can browse submitted games [here](http://ultimatefris.be/games).

The game database is searchable by location only. Any terms will be matched using a simple SQL query of "LIKE '%terms%'". I would welcome any more advanced suggestions.
